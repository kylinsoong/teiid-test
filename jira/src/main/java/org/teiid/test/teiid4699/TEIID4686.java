/**
 * This example is same as "Teiid Quick Start Example", you can find at http://jboss.org/teiid/quickstart
 * whereas the example shows how to use Dynamic VDB using a server based deployment, this below code shows to use same
 * example using Embedded Teiid. This uses a memory based H2 database and File source as sources and provides a 
 * view layer using DDL. 
 * 
 * Note that this example shows how to integrate the traditional sources like jdbc, file, web-service etc, however you are 
 * not limited to only those sources. As long as you can extended and provide implementations for
 *  - ConnectionfactoryProvider
 *  - Translator
 *  - Metadata Repository
 *  
 *  you can integrate any kind of sources together, or provide a JDBC interface on a source or expose with with known schema.
